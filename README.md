# AEtextures
A built in texture library for after effects, WIP
Preset textures location is C:/presetAETextures, drag any textures you want in the preset textures tab into that folder!

To add
+ Preset folder path will be created with textures inside (from texturelabs?)
+ information tab explaining how the script works and where to find presetfolder path etc.
+ Tooltips for buttons
+ Support for video files, with preview
+ Different color for video and image
+ Move towards overlay library than just texture
+ Stylized UI
+ Support for GLB files (!?)

# How to install
Go to your after effects install > Support Files > Scripts > ScriptUI Panels > Put script in that folder. 
i.e. C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects 2024\Support Files\Scripts\ScriptUI Panels
